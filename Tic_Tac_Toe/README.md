# Infinity_games
My first games, created using Python.
one_by_one.py require two players.
AI_to_user.py require Internet access and input devices as Microfon for taking you moves and you also need some speaker for listening the response from the computer :).
# To install the requiremnts.txt file open the terminal and paste 
pip install -r requirements.txt
 
 # Playing Tic Tac Toe
 If "friend" == True:
  you want to play the game with your friend on the same computer, sharing the input devices you can use the **one_by_one.py** file to play with your frind.
 Else:
  If you want to play the game alone with the computer itself and want to choose the moves using speech recognition library, you **must have an internet      connection** for being able to convert sound to text. The program is compatible with Linux, MacOS and Windows operation system.
